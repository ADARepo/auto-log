Can run the script as is after inputting credentials in the .ini for logging into SWTOR. I also made it an executable on my own machine.
Will modify in the future to work with other applications instead of just SWTOR, the problem  has been UAC.

TODO:
- Change from being time based to work around UAC prompt and instead just rely on images
- Instead of positioning for mouse clicks, instead rely fully on image processing since the launcher UI could be moved
    - This usually isn't a problem since the launcher opens in the same spot every time
